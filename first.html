<p>Rohit continued to oscillate in and out of the Indian eleven without being able to establish himself in the side,
 having been given ample opportunities despite a well-established Indian middle-order. Alas, after making it to the 
 Playing XI for the Nagpur Test against South Africa in 2010, he was lamentably injured in a warm-up football game after
 coming heart-breakingly close to receiving the coveted India cap. He was subsequently ruled out of the series in a 
 gut-wrenching turn of events, and wouldn't get another opportunity to prove his Test credentials for another 4 years.
